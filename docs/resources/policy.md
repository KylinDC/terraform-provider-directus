# directus_policy (Resource)

Manages a Directus access policy. Policies are composable units that define a specific set of access permissions and can be attached to one or more roles via `directus_role_policies_attachment`.

Policies control Data Studio access, admin privileges, two-factor authentication requirements, and IP-based restrictions. See the [Directus Policies API documentation](https://docs.directus.io/reference/system/policies.html) for more details.

  app_access  = true
}
```
